# SW_test
# Oblig_3_ver_1
# This is a documentation of how I performed in this oblig_3.
# To carry out this oblig_3, I went to github's official home page and used their dox.
# It explained what we were going to do step by step.
# First we used git bash to check if we had the updated version of github 
# Then we used gitbash to connect the project to github. 
# After we connect the project to github. 
# The last thing we did was create a new flow for testing and this function.
# And done.
